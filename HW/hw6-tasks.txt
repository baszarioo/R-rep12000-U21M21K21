    ==  Statiistical Tets: Homogeneity  ==
Task1: The number of unsatisfactory grades obtained in the examination of a certain subject by equally sized groups of first-year students at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of a university were as follows:
Group:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12  13
Ndst:   14  18  28  12  4   22  14  16  10  8   18  6   12
At a significance level of 0.05, use the X^2 test to verify the hypothesis that the probabilities of obtaining unsatisfactory grades in these groups are equal.

Task2:  The numbers of errors were determined during the correction of a 500-page book. The results describing the number of errors on consecutive pages are contained in the file "errors.txt" At a significance level of 0.05, verify the hypothesis that the number of errors per page follows a Poisson distribution.

Task3:  A random number generator produced 30 numbers from an exponential distribution E(2). The numbers are sorted in non-decreasing order:
    0.02, 0.03, 0.03, 0.04, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.11, 0.11, 0.16, 0.18, 0.22, 0.24, 0.26, 0.27, 0.36, 0.44, 0.46, 0.46, 0.60, 0.65, 0.65, 0.70, 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, 0.95, 1.20, 1.50, 2.00.
Using the Kolmogorov test at a significance level of 0.05, test the conformity of these data with the E(2) distribution.

Task4:  Fifteen measurements of the time to eliminate defect on a ring spinning machine were conducted, yielding values (in seconds):
    4.5, 3.6, 6.0, 6.4, 7.9, 6.9, 6.1, 7.4, 9.0, 4.3, 6.1, 8.2, 4.9, 7.5, 5.8;
By performing the appropriate test, verify at a significance level of 0.05 the hypothesis that the time to eliminate defects follows a normal distribution N(6,3;(1.5)^2)...

Task5: Load the file "variables.txt" into R:
a) Check whether any of the variables, variable1, variable2, variable3, have the same distributions. Use the appropriate test and empirical cumulative distribution plots for all three samples.

b) By conducting appropriate tests, attempt to determine the specific distributions from which the analyzed samples originate.
