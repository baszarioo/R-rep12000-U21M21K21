To create a sample that contains 2 different random numbers form range of (1,10), you can use the command:
sample(1:10,2) 
||or
sample(10,2);


Vector iven as an prob parameter of sample() function, that determines the probability to select some defined elements from a source vector, should be:
same size a s a vector, from which we randomize elements, but sum of its parameters cant be equal to 1.


Which of the commands is not valid?
sample(10,100)


Function that allows to count distribution quantiles of t-Student is a:
qt()


Function that allows to count a distribuant of chi-kwadrat distribution is a:
pchisq()


Command, that can generate:
* four random numbers from beta(2,3) distribution is a: 
rbeta(4,2,3);
* three random numbers from bera(4,2) distribution is a:
rbeta(3,4,2);
* three random numbers from (beta2,4) distribution is a:
rbeta(3,2,4)


[V]olume of a gamma distribution can be achieved by using a function: 
dgamma()


command of plot.etdf(x, verticals=TRUE) in return gives:
Prints a "stair"-like chart - of empirical distribuant for random sample x, that adjoins the diff. points by straight lines.


Distribuant's chart of F-Snedocors with 5 and 6- levels of latitude(tolerancy) can be obtained by a command of:
curve(pf(x,5,6),fropm=0, to=1)
curve(pf(x,5,6))


Randomized sample comin from Weibull's distribution can be generated by a command:
rweibull();


Generate a random sample x of size 8 by doing so:
 - the sample has to contain small/large alphabet letters, that can repeat themselves,
 - i-th letter in alphabetic order ( firstly small, then large ) has to appear in a sample with a probability of i/(n+1), it means that, for example: last letter has a prob. of appearing = 52/53.

alphabet = c(letters,LETTERS);
sample(alphabet,size=9,replace=TRUE);

alphabet=c(letters,LETTERS)
sample(alphabet,size=8,prob=seq(1,length(alphabet))/length(alphabet),replace=TRUE);


exponential distribution's volume with a parameter of 4 in a 1/2 point.
dexp(1/2,rate=4);


distribuant of steady distribution on (-3,3) range in a point of 0.
punif(0,-3,3)


bottom quantile of normal distribution with a mean = 5, and a variance of 9.
qnorm(0.25,mean=5,sd=sqrt(9));
